# New-York-city-taxi-fare-prediction
New York City Taxi Fare Prediction is a project that aims to develop a model that can estimate the cost of a taxi ride in NYC using the power of Machine Learning. This involves analyzing historical taxi ride data, which includes factors such as distance traveled, pickup and drop-off locations, time of day, and potentially other variables like traffic conditions or weather. Various Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, Boosting etc. are then used to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the fare for a given taxi ride. This project can be valuable for both taxi passengers looking to estimate their fare in advance and taxi companies seeking to optimize pricing strategies and improve customer service.
